CrOS User Policy Editor. *Genorator Coming Soon :D*

## Pollen v2 :D
Pollen v2 Launches Soon (Or It Might Have Already)
Added:
  - User Policy Genorator
  - RootFS Version


## How To Use
- Note: Devmode **NEEDS** to be enabled. Use some sort of exploit like sh1mmer to enable devmode
- Open Crosh
- Type In `shell`
- Type In `sudo su`
- Type In `sudo curl -k https://pollen.scarat3k.me/Pollen.sh | bash`

## How It Works
It works by loading a custom user policy in to CrOS. (Similar to how policies on windows work)\
Using this we can either disenable RootFS or temporarily to load it.\
CrOS does not have the folder to load it built-in, however the src code is still there so we can manually create it.\
Then simpily we just create the file and restart.
